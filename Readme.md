# SOAR Simple GPS Trackers

[PWA UI](https://soar-simple-gps.netlify.app/)

## How to Develop
Make sure you have node installed in your computer. If not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Clone the repository
2. Change directory to `simple-gps-pwa`
3. Install all dependencies```npm install```
4. Run the development preview with ```ionic serve```

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React and the Ionic Framework. Here are some useful documentation on how to develop with Ionic:
- [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs)

Given that Ionic already has a lot of components and utilities, you can easily build the app without having to write a lot of custom CSS. However, if you need to write custom CSS, you can do so by creating a new CSS file in the `src` folder and importing it in the corresponding component.

Feel free to break the app, that's why we have git ðŸ˜Ž.

## How to Build
1. Run ```ionic build```
2. Make sure a `dist` folder is created
3. To preview the build run ```npm run preview```

## How to Deploy
For now only @L42ARO has the account to deploy the app. If you want create a netlify account with the SOAR email to be able to deploy the app.
